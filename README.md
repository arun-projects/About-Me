# About Me

- For this lab we will be creating a personal landing page using HTML and CSS.
- A starter page has been created for you which you can download here.
- This is meant to be creative, but make sure to at least do the following:
	- Add the class "fixed-top" to the navbar to make it stay in place during scroll.
	- Use rgba colors to make the header navbar semi-transparent.
	- Use Google Fonts to implement a font of your choice for the logo.
	- Replace the picture of me with one of you. You will need to look up the `img` tag to make this happen.
	- Replace the picture of the motorcycle with a background of your choice (Hint: Have a look at the CSS to find out where this background comes from).
	- Make the background of the banner have a parallax effect. Hint: Research the "background-attachment" property in CSS.
	- Change the text throughout the page to reflect your own personal information.
	- Add a gradient to the background of the user-info-text class in CSS.
	- **Bonus:** Implement a small animation using CSS somewhere on the page. You may want to research the `transition` and `transform` CSS properties.
- We will be discussing how to make this web page live using a service called BitBalloon.
